**Qwen Image Edit for Urbanism** brings localized, text-driven image editing to urban and architectural workflows using the open-source **Qwen-Image-Edit** model in **GGUF format**. All processing runs fully offline — no API, no cloud — making it ideal for architects, planners, and researchers who need privacy, reproducibility, and full visual control.
